# HTT-repeat-analysis

=======

This is a program developed for analysis of tri-nucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, starting from PacBio SMRT sequencing data generated by [targeted enrichment using CRISPR/Cas9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/humu.23580).

Check out Wiki to learn how to execute the program - [Wiki](https://github.com/NationalGenomicsInfrastructure/HTT-repeat-analysis/wiki)
